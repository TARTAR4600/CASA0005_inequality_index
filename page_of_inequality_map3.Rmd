## Introduction

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
```

The **Gender Inequality Index (GII)** is a composite measure developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to assess gender disparities in various dimensions of human development[^1]. It highlights the inequalities between men and women in three critical areas: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation.

This page transforms those statistical insights into an interactive map, allowing users to explore gender inequality patterns geographically.The map of the world provided by ESRI[^2].
